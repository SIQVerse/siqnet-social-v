## 🧘🏿 The Zulu Principle  
**Silence before impact. Reflection before revelation.**

SIQNet is guided by the Zulu Principle of Communicative Silence — a leadership philosophy rooted in clarity, presence, and intentionality.

## 🧠 What Is SIQ?

**Silence Intelligence Quotient (SIQ)** is a new metric for leadership:
